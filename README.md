# Facial Keypoint Detection
This project focuses on implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for facial keypoint detection. The project consists of three key files:

1. `Define the Network Architecture.ipynb`: In this Jupyter Notebook, you'll define the CNN architecture for facial keypoint detection. The notebook provides a comprehensive understanding of the model structure and the design choices made during network construction. It includes details on defining a CNN with images as input and keypoints as output, creating the transformed FaceKeypointsDataset, and training the model while tracking loss. The notebook also addresses the evaluation of model performance on test data and provides insights into modifying the CNN structure and hyperparameters to enhance performance. You can also find information on feature visualization to understand what each convolutional layer has been trained to recognize.

2. `Facial Keypoint Detection, Complete Pipeline.ipynb`: In this Jupyter Notebook, you will find a complete pipeline for facial keypoint detection. This includes data loading, model training, keypoint prediction, and evaluation. The notebook serves as a practical guide to applying the defined CNN architecture to the task of facial keypoint detection.

3. `models.py`: This Python script defines the CNN architecture for facial keypoint detection. It is the code representation of the architecture discussed in the "2. Define the Network Architecture" notebook. The script is designed for reusability across different project notebooks.

4. `requirements.txt`: This file contains a list of the required dependencies to run the project.
